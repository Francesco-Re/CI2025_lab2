The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that seeks the shortest possible route visiting a set of locations exactly once and returning to the starting point.
 It is formally defined as finding the shortest closed path that visits each vertex in a graph exactly once, where the graph is typically undirected and weighted, with vertices representing cities and edge weights representing distances or costs.
 The problem is NP-hard, meaning no known polynomial-time algorithm can solve all instances optimally, and the number of possible routes grows factorially with the number of cities, making brute-force solutions impractical for large instances
